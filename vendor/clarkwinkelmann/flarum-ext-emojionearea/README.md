This extension adds the [EmojiOne Area](https://github.com/mervick/emojionearea) emoji picker to [Flarum](https://github.com/flarum).

Please note that, as the name suggests, the emoji list and images used in this library are Emojione, which was previously used by Flarum until beta 7.

However Flarum now switched to Twemoji, which means the images shown in the picker and those inserted in the post will be (slightly or radically) different.

Install it:

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-emojionearea
